# deduplication

R package for computing the duplicity probability for mobile devices.

One way to install the package is by calling from R console

>devtools::install_github("bogdanoancea/deduplication", build = TRUE)

For installing only the x64 build, an option is needed to be passed beforehand

>options(devtools.install.args = "--no-multiarch").
