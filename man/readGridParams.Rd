\title{Reads the parameters of the grid.}
\usage{
readGridParams(gridFileName)
}
\arguments{
\item{gridFileName}{The name of the file with the grid parameters. This file could be the one
generated by the simulation software or can be created with any text editor. The grid file
generated by the simulation software has the following columns: \code{Origin X, Origin Y, X
Tile Dim, Y Tile Dim, No Tiles X, No Tiles Y}. We are interested only in the number of rows and
columns and the tile size on OX and OY axes. Therefore, the file provided as input to this
function should have at least the following 4 columns: 'No Tiles X' ,'No Tiles X, 'X Tile Dim'
and 'Y Tile Dim'.}
}
\value{
Returns a list with the following items: \code{nrow} - the number of rows, i.e. the
  number of tiles in a column of the grid, \code{ncol} - the number of columns, i.e. the number
  of tiles in a row of the grid, \code{tileX} - the dimension of a tile on OX axis, \code{tileY}
  - the dimension of a tile on OY axis
}
\description{
Reads the parameters of the grid overpalled on the geographical area of interest
  from a .csv file.
