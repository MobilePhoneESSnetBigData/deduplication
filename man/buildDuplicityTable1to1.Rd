\value{
a data.table object with two columns: the device IDs and the corresponding duplicity probability for each
  device.

\description{
Builds a datatable with with two columns: device IDs and the duplicity probability for each device. This
  function is called in case of using the "1to1" method of computing the dupicity probabilities, receiving a list of
  matrix objects returned by each worker node with lines correponding to a subset of devices. These parts a put
  together and form a symmetic matrix used to compute the duplicity probability. It is a utility function and it is
  not accesible from outside the package.
