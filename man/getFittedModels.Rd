\title{Fits the HMM models for each device.}
\usage{
getFittedModels(ndevices, model, connections)
}
\arguments{
\item{ndevices}{The number of devices.}

\item{model}{The HMM model returned by \code{getGenericModel()} function. This model is to be fit for each device.}

\item{connections}{A matrix whose elements are the antenna ID where a device is connected at every time instant. This
matrix is returned by \code{getConnections()} function.}
}
\value{
A vector of fitted model for each device.
}
\description{
Fits the HMM model for each device using the \code{fit()} function from \code{destim} package. The
  computations are done in parallel to reduce the running time using all the available cores. This function creates a
  cluster of working nodes, splits the devices equally and assign a partition of devices to each node in the cluster.
  For Unix-like operating systems, this functions uses a "FORK" cluster while for Windows it uses a "SOCK" cluster.
