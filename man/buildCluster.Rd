\description{
Build a cluster of working nodes using the parallel package. On Unix-like operating systems it builds as
  "FORK" cluster while on Windows it builds a "SOCKET" cluster. Ther number of working nodes equals the number of 
  available (logical) cores as it is detected by the call of \code{detectCores()} function. On Windows, it also exports
  a list of variables and an environment passed as arguments.
