\title{Reads a file with the posterior location probabilities.}
\usage{
readPostLocProb(path, prefixName, deviceID)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{The path to the location where the posterior location probabilities are stored. The file with the
location probabilities should have the name \code{postLocDevice_ID.csv} where \code{ID} is replaced with the device
ID.}

\item{prefixName}{The file name prefix. The whole file name is composed by a concatenation of \code{prefixName},
\code{_} and \code{deviceID}.}

\item{deviceID}{The device ID for which the posterior location probabilities are read.}
}
\value{
A Matrix object with the posterior location probabilities for the device with ID equals to deviceID. A row
  corresponds to a tile and a column corresponds to a time instant.
}
\description{
Reads a .csv file with the posterior location probabilities. Each row of the file corresponds to a tile
  and each column corresponds to a time instant.
