\usage{
getEmissionProbs(
  nrows,
  ncols,
  signalFileName,
  sigMin,
  handoverType = "strength",
  simulatedData = TRUE,
  emissionModel = NULL,
  antennaFileName = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{signalFileName}{The name of the .csv file that contains the signal strength/quality for each tile in the grid.
This file is one of the outputs of the data simulator. The data is organized as a matrix with the number of rows
equals to the number of antennas and the the following columns: \code{Antenna ID, Tile 0, Tile 1, ... Tile (N-1)}.
On the first column there are the antenna IDs and on the rest of the columns the coresponding signal 
strength/quality.}

\item{sigMin}{The minimum value of the signal strength/quality that allow a connection between a device and an
antenna.}

\item{handoverType}{The handover mechanism used by the mobile network. It could have two values:'strenght' or
'quality'}

\item{simulatedData}{If TRUE, the input data provided to this function come from tha simulator otherwise the data 
come from a real mobile network.}

\item{nrow}{the number of rows in the grid. It can be obtained by calling \code{readGridParams}.}

\item{ncol}{the number of columns in the grid. It can be obtained by calling \code{readGridParams}.}
}
\value{
Returns a Matrix object with the emmission probabilities for the HMM. The number of rows equals the
number of tiles in the grid and the number of columns equals the number of antennas. An element (i,j) of
this matrix coresponds to the probability of a device being in tile i to be connected to antena j. The row
names of the matrix are the tile indices and the column names are the antenna IDs.
}
\description{
Builds the emission probabilities needed for the HMM used to estimate the posterior location
probabilitities.
In case of using simulated data, these probabilities are build using the signal strength or signal quality outputed
by the simulation software for each tile in the grid.
