\title{Computes the probability distribution for Delta X and Delta Y.}
\usage{
buildDeltaProb(xp1, xp2)
}
\arguments{
\item{xp1}{a data.table object with 3 columns representing the x and y coordinates of the centroids of tiles in the
grid and the location probability for each corresponding tile for the first device.}

\item{xp2}{a data.table object with 3 columns representing the x and y coordinates of the centroids of tiles in the
grid and the location probability for each corresponding tile for the second device.}
}
\value{
a list with two data.table objects, the first is the probability distribution for Delta X and the second for
  Delta Y. The elements are named DeltaX and DeltaY.
}
\description{
Computes the probability distribution for Delta X and Delta Y where Delta X / Delta Y are the
  differences between the centroids of the tiles on OX / OY. For a detailed explanation of what Delta X and Delta Y
  mean please reffer to
