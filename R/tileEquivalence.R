#' @title Transforms the tiles indices from the notation used by the simulation software to the one used by the raster
#'   package.
#'
#' @description In order to perform the population estimations, the area of interest is overlapped with a rectangular
#'   grid of tiles. Each tile is a rectangle with predefined dimensions. This function is a utility function which
#'   transform the tiles indices from the numbering system used by the simulation software to the one used by the
#'   \pkg{raster} package. The simulation software uses a notation where the tile with index 0 is the bottom left tile while
#'   the raster package uses another way to number the tiles, tiles being numbered starting with 1 for the upper left
#'   tile.
#'
#' @param nrow Number of rows in the grid overpalling the area of interest.
#'
#' @param ncol Number of columns in the grid overpalling the area of interest.
#'
#' @return Returns a data.frame object with two columns: on the first column are the tile indices according to the
#'   raster package numbering and on the second column are the equivalent tile indices according to the simulation
#'   software numbering.
