#' @title Fits the HMM models for each device.
#'
#' @description Fits the HMM model for each device using the \code{fit()} function from \code{destim} package. The
#'   computations are done in parallel to reduce the running time using all the available cores. This function creates a
#'   cluster of working nodes, splits the devices equally and assign a partition of devices to each node in the cluster.
#'   For Unix-like operating systems, this functions uses a "FORK" cluster while for Windows it uses a "SOCK" cluster.
#'
#' @param ndevices The number of devices.
#'
#' @param model The HMM model returned by \code{getGenericModel()} function. This model is to be fit for each device.
#'
#' @param connections A matrix whose elements are the antenna ID where a device is connected at every time instant. This
#'   matrix is returned by \code{getConnections()} function.
#'
#'
#' @return A vector of log likelihoods computed using the fitted model for each device.
