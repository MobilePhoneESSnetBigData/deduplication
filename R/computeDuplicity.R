#'@title Computes the duplicity probability for each device.
#'
#'@description Computes the duplicity probability for each device using three different methods: pairs, 1-to-1 and
#'  trajectory. The theory behind these methods is described in detail in
#'  \href{https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/mwikis/essnetbigdata/images/f/fb/WPI_Deliverable_I3_A_proposed_production_framework_with_mobile_network_data_2020_05_31_draft.pdf}{WPI
#'   Deliverable 3} and in the paper \emph{An end-to-end statistical process with mobile network data for Official
#'  Statistics}.
#'
#'@param method The method used to compute the duplicity probability. It could have one of the following values:
#'  "pairs", "1to1", "trajectory".
#'
#'@param gridFileName The name of the file with the grid parameters. This file could be the one generated by the
#'  simulation software or can be created with any text editor. The grid file generated by the simulation software has
#'  the following columns: \code{Origin X, Origin Y, X Tile Dim, Y Tile Dim, No Tiles X, No Tiles Y}. We are interested
#'  only in the number of rows and columns and the tile size on OX and OY axes. Therefore, the file provided as input to
#'  this function should have at least the following 4 columns: 'No Tiles X' ,'No Tiles Y, 'X Tile Dim' and 'Y Tile
#'  Dim'.
#'
#'@param eventsFileName The name of the file with the network events to be used. Depending on the parameter
#'  \code{simulatedData} it could be a .csv file coming from the simulation software or from a real MNO. In case the
#'  file comes from the simulation software it contains following columns: \code{time, antennaID, eventCode, deviceID,
#'  x, y, tile} Only the first 4 columns are used, the rest are ignored.
#'
#'@param signalFileName The name of the .csv file that contains the signal strength/quality for each tile in the grid.
#'  Depending on the parameter \code{simulatedData} it could be a .csv file coming from the simulation software or from
#'  a real MNO. In case the file comes from the simulation software the data are organized as a matrix with the number
#'  of rows equals to the number of antennas and the the following columns: \code{Antenna ID, Tile 0, Tile 1, ... Tile
#'  (N-1)}. On the first column there are the antenna IDs and on the rest of the columns the coresponding signal
#'  strength/quality for each tile in the grid.
#'
#'@param cellsFileName It is the name of the file where the coverage areas of antennas are to be found. It is a should
#'  be a .csv file with two values on each row: the antenna ID and a WKT string representing a polygon (i.e. it should
#'  start with the word POLYGON) which is the coverage area of the corresponding antenna. This area is also called the
#'  antenna cell.
#'
#'@param simulatedData If TRUE the input data are provided by the simulation software, otherwise real data is used.
#'
#'@param simulationFileName The name of the file used to define a simulation scenario. It is the file that was provided
#'  as input for the simulation software. This file is required only if simulatedData is TRUE.
#'
#'@param netParams This parameter is required if simulatedData is FALSE, i.e. the deduplication package uses real mobile
#'  network data. In this case, netParam is a list with two elements: conn_threshold and prob_sec_mobile_phone.
#'  conn_threshold is the minimum value of the signal strength/quality that can be used to connect a mobile device to an
#'  antenna. If the signal in a region is below this value the region is considered out of the coverage area.
#'  prob_sec_mobile_phone is the probability of a person to have two mobile devices.
#'
#'@param path The path where the files with the posterior location probabilities for each device are to be found. This
#'  parameter is needed only if the "trajectory" method is used.
#'
#'@param gamma This value is used only for the "trajectory" method and is the factor used in the compariosn between the
#'  mode of Delta X and Delta Y and the dispersion radius. The default value is 0.5.
#'
#'@param aprioriProbModel This parameter is used to initialize the apriori probabilities for the HMM model for each
#'  device. The default value is NULL which means that by default the models are initialized with the steady state.
#'
#'@param aprioriJointModel This parameter is used to initialize the apriori probabilities for the joint HMM models for
#'  each pair of two devices. The default value is NULL which means that by default the models are initialized with the
#'  steady state.
#'
#'@param lambda This parameter is used in combination with the "1-to-1" method. If it is NULL (which is the default
#'  value) the computations follow the description given in
#'  \href{https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/mwikis/essnetbigdata/images/f/fb/WPI_Deliverable_I3_A_proposed_production_framework_with_mobile_network_data_2020_05_31_draft.pdf}{WPI
#'   Deliverable 3}, otherwise the coputations proceed as is the \emph{An end-to-end statistical process with mobile
#'  network data for Official Statistics} paper.
#'
#'@param handoverType The handover mechanism used by the mobile network. It could have two values: "strength" or
#'  "quality". The default value is "strength". This parameter is used to compute the emission probabilities for the HMM
#'  models using the values from the signal file. If this file contains the signal strength then the handoverType should
#'  be set to "strength" and if the file contains the values of the signal quality then the parameter should be set to
#'  "quality".
#'
#'@param emissionModel This parameter dictates how the emission probabilities for the HMM models are computed. It can
#'  have two values: "RSS" and "SDM". Normally, the emission probabilities are computed using the signal values from the
#'  signal file assuming that if the handoverType is set to "strength" then the signal file contains the strength values
#'  and if the handoverType is set to "quality" the signal file contains the quality of the signal. For demonstrative
#'  purposes the package supports unsual combination. If handoverType is set to "strength", the signal file contains the
#'  signal strength but the emissionModel is set to "SDM" the signal strength values are transformed to signal quality
#'  and then the computation of the emission probablities uses these transformed values. If handoverType is set to
#'  "quality", the signal file contains the signal quality but the emissionModel is set to "RSS" the signal quality
#'  values are transformed to signal strength and then the computation of the emission probablities uses these
#'  transformed values.
#'
#'@param antennaFileName The name of the xml file containing the technical parameters of the antennas needed to
#'  transform the signal quality into signal strength and vice versa. This is an input file of the simulation software.
#'  An example file is included in this package. The default value is NULL because this file is only needed to make
#'  unusual combinations between handoverType and the way the emission probabilities are computed.
#'
#'
#'@return a data.table object with two columns: 'deviceID' and 'dupP'. On the first column there are deviceIDs and on
#'  the second column the corresponding duplicity probability, i.e. the probability that a device is in a 2-to-1
#'  correspondence with its holder.
